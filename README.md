1. **Palindrome**: find out if a string is palindrome, for example, deed, level are palindrome.
   * get the length
   * compare 1st and last letter using a loop
   * <Palindrome.java>

3. **Anagram**: An anagram is a word or a phrase made by transposing the letters of another word or phrase; for example, "parliament" is an anagram of "partial men," and "software" is an anagram of "swear oft."
